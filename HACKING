BUILDING
-----

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
    make

TESTING
-----
To test the UI, simply run the `pantheon-greeter` executable in the build
directory.

To test how it interacts with LightDM, you need to install it globally via:

    sudo make install

And then run LightDM in test mode:

    lightdm --test-mode --debug

To do this, you need to have Xephyr installed. You can then find the debug log
of the greeter in `~/.cache/lightdm/log`.
